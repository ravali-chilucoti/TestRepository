## Welcome to GitHub Pages

This is my first project. Just a sample one which decribes the html.Add different styles like color, font size, background-color to the text and also put the text in different html tags like h1 to h6, p, b, i tags.And also put some forms with elements and can perform crud operations on them.
Instructions:
Only add express js files(i.e. ejs files) to this project as it only supports them through the script files which are in the github. First install node and then the packages which are mentioned in package.json nd then run the project.
